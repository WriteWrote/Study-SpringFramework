# Study-SpringFramework
Studying spring-course from alishev: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ePo08sqcpk&amp;ab_channel=alishev

**Task1:** first of all, I'll create a project, using tips from alishev.youtube-channel. Then I'll recreate step by step structure of MusicPlayer to learn in practice how manage SpringFramework.
After that I'll try to fulfill the exercise in the end of Lesson 6: modify MusicPlayer, so it could play a whole list of music genres.
